    <h2 id="IDH"> Hobbies </h2>
    <p> From a young age, I have had a deep passion for video games and the production of them. This had led me to having the vision of producing games that provide the younger generation with same excitement as I had when growing up. However, this passion has manifested into something greater over the years. My main mission now is to provide the larger population with a user experience that will make day to day life easier using the software that I produce, not just the younger generation. This has driven me to develop my understanding of code from a very young age. I think this was time well spend considering I now know a considerable amount of C# and Python. </p>
    <p> On top of this, I took part in the cyber security challenge set by Cyber Discovery. This is a really interesting to me because I have learnt a great deal in terms of ethical hacking and cyber security. This includes using SSH, SQL injections and packet analysing.  </p>
    <p> I also have a deep interest for philosophy. This interest has been developed from the early stages of my life. I like to think and question topics that others may have not even considered doing so. I believe I believe I like this is because I have the ability to think outside the box and present new ideas to others.   </p>
    <p> Technology is the main thing I focus on in my spare time. I have a great passion for all things technological; hardware and software wise. I have looked into the idea of hardware design and software development and have been intrigued by the two. One day I would like to have a career in either one of these fields. </p>
